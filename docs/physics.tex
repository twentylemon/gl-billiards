        \subsection{Taking a Shot}
        Once a ball is hit by the cue, there are two ways energy is transferred to the ball. First, and more noticeable of the two
        is the transfer of linear momentum. This sends the ball moving around the table in straight lines. Second is the transfer
        of angular momentum, which applies spin to the ball. Spin can cause the ball to stop in it's tracks after a collision,
        bounce off cushions in strange (but predictable) ways and to any pool player, is just as if not more important an aspect
        to the game as the linear momentum.
            \subsubsection{Linear Momentum}
            To simplify the shot making process, the pool cue is assuming to act like a spring. That is, the further you pull
            the cue away from the cue you are going to hit, the more powerful your shot will be. Spring motion can be described
            using Hooke's Law,
            \begin{equation}
                \vec F = -k \vec x
                \label{equ:hookes_law}
            \end{equation}
            where, $\vec F$ is the force, $\vec x$ is how much the spring is stretched and $k$ is the spring constant, which
            describes basically how powerful (springy) the spring is.
            \\
            Hooke's Law is equivalent to Newton's Second Law, which states
            \begin{equation}
                \vec F = m \vec a
                \label{equ:newton}
            \end{equation}
            where, $\vec F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass of the object and $\vec a$ is the acceleration of the object. Setting
            Equation~\ref{equ:hookes_law} equal to Equation~\ref{equ:newton} gives
            \begin{eqnarray}
                -k \vec x &=& m \vec a \nonumber \\
                -k \vec x &=& m \frac{\Delta \vec v}{\Delta t} \nonumber \\
                \Delta \vec v &=& \frac{-k \Delta t}{m}\vec x  \nonumber
            \end{eqnarray}
            where $\vec v$ is the velocity of the object, and $t$ is the time. For pool, the initial velocity of the ball being struck is
            always zero, so we can simplify the above equation to
            \begin{equation}
                \vec v = \frac{-k t}{m}\vec x
                \label{equ:shot_velocity}
            \end{equation}
            where $\vec x$ is the distance between the ball and the tip of the cue, $m$ is the mass of the ball, $t$ is how much time the
            cue is in contact with the ball and $k$ is the spring constant of the cue. The values for $t$ and $k$ needed to be experimentally
            found though trial and error, essentially trying values until what happened in the simulation closely represented real life. The
            values for $t$ and $k$ were found to be $0.1$s and $10$N/m.
            %\end{Linear Velocity}
            
            \subsubsection{Angular Momentum}
            Angular momentum transfer is more complex. The starting point for this section is also Newton's Second Law, but written
            in a form more usable to the problem at hand.
            \begin{equation}
                \vec \tau = I \vec \alpha
                \label{equ:newton_rotation}
            \end{equation}
            where $\vec \tau$ is the torque applied to the object around it's center of rotation, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the
            object and $\vec \alpha$ is the angular acceleration of the object.
            \\
            Torque is always given by the equation,
            \begin{equation}
                \vec \tau = \vec r \times \vec F
                \label{equ:torque}
            \end{equation}
            where $\vec F$ is the force being applied, $\vec r$ is the vector between where the force is being applied and the center
            of rotation of the object, and $\times$ is the vector cross product.
            \\
            An important note is the inertia for a solid sphere is given by,
            \begin{equation}
                I_{sphere} = \frac{2}{5} m R^2
                \label{equ:inertia_sphere}
            \end{equation}
            where $R$ is the radius and $m$ is the mass of the sphere.
            \\
            Setting Equation~\ref{equ:newton_rotation} equal to Equation~\ref{equ:torque}, subbing in Equation~\ref{equ:inertia_sphere}
            for $I$ and Equation~\ref{equ:hookes_law} for $\vec F$, and solving gives,
            \begin{eqnarray}
                \vec r \times -k \vec x &=& \frac{2}{5} m R^2 \frac{\Delta \vec \omega}{\Delta t} \nonumber \\
                \Delta \vec \omega &=& \frac{5}{2} \left(\frac{\Delta t}{m R^2}\right) (\vec r \times -k \vec x) \nonumber
            \end{eqnarray}
            where $\vec \omega$ is the angular velocity of the ball, and $t$ $t$ is how much time the cue is in contact with the ball (the same $t$
            as in the previous section). Again, for pool, when the ball is struck it is entirely at rest, so the initial angular velocity is zero.
            The above equation then simplifies to
            \begin{equation}
                \vec \omega = \frac{5}{2} \left(\frac{\Delta t}{m R^2}\right) (\vec r \times -k \vec x)
                \label{equ:shot_angular}
            \end{equation}
            where $\vec x$ is the distance between the ball and the tip of the cue, $m$ is the mass of the ball, $R$ is the radius of the ball,
            $t$ is how much time the cue is in contact with the ball, $k$ is the spring constant of the cue and finally $\vec r$ is the vector
            between the center of the ball and where the cue strikes the ball.
            %\end{Angular Velocity}
        %\end{Taking a Shot}
        
        \subsection{Event Detection}
        For the purposes of this program, an event is a ball-ball collision, or a ball banking off of the cushion. The way gl-billiards works
        is each time the screen is redisplayed, some physics updater function is called with a parameter $dt$, which is how much time has passed
        since the last frame. The engine simulates the pool game up until a time $dt$ has passed. For example, if $1$s was passed, then it would
        simulate $1$s of play before returning, then the screen would be updated as if $1$s had passed.
        \\
        So, the engine determines which events occur within time $dt$. Event detection then becomes \textit{when} do events happen instead
        of \textit{if} they happened. The entire update function works as follows:\\
        \texttt{
            update($dt$)                                                        \\
            \begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
            find earliest event that occurs within time $dt$, call it $event$   \\
            if no such event                                                    \\
                \begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
                roll balls until $dt$                                           \\
                \end{addmargin}
            otherwise                                                           \\
                \begin{addmargin}[1em]{0em}
                roll balls until $event$ occurs                                 \\
                handle $event$                                                  \\
                $dt$ <-- $dt$ - $event$.$getTime()$                             \\
                call update($dt$) again                                         \\
                \end{addmargin}
            \end{addmargin}
        }
        In this manner, all events that happen within $dt$ and handled automatically before the frame updates and the balls slow
        down due to friction. Note that "roll balls" simply means each ball moves at it's speed for some amount of time. Pocketing
        detection needs to be done there, as it is not a standard event. That is, if a ball is pocketed, it cannot possible participate
        in any events in time $dt$, since it would bank off the cushion or collide with another ball first.
